# Shading Correction

## Overview 

This example creates and saves a calibration file which is required for camera shading correction.  Options are provided to deploy a calibration file (if already created) from the disk to the camera, or download and save the file from the camera to disk. It also provides debug messages when debug mode is turned on, giving more detailed progress status and error messages to the user.
