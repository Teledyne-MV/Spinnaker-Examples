# TimeSync

## Overview 

## Description 

This example is basically the "actioncommand" example, with no mentions of actioncommands; it focuses instead on synchronizing the clocks of each connected camera. With multiple Gen3 gige cameras connected (on the same bus), the application will use one camera's clock as the "master clock" and have all of the other connected cameras match that camera's clock.  For further details on this example, please take a look at our article, "Precision System Synchronization with the IEEE-1588 Precision Time Protocol (PTP); https://www.flir.ca/discover/iis/machine-vision/precision-system-synchronization-with-the-ieee-1588-precision-time-protocol-ptp/
